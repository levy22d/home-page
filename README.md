# home-page
This is a small project using vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML that:
 - Greets a user with their name, which is saved in client-side storage (and can be edited).
 - Uses different greetings, depending on the time of day.
 - Displays the current time (in AM/PM).
 - Changes background color to a different random pastel color on refresh.
 - Allows the user to make links to their favorite websites, which are also saved in client-side storage (and can be added/removed as needed).
